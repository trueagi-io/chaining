# Chaining Experiments in MeTTa

- [backward-chaining](backward-chaining): backward chaining
  experiments, both using proof as program and proof as program
  execution trace.

- [common](common): some reusable type and function definitions.

- [converters](converters): functions to convert rule formats, such as
  curried to uncurried, dependent types to functional.

- [curried-chaining](curried-chaining): backward and forward chaining
  experiments using curried rules.

- [forward-chaining](forward-chaining): forward chaining experiments,
  both using proof as program and proof as program execution trace.

- [hol](hol): higher order logic, attempt to reason about programs,
  such as providing that 0 is the right identity of +.

- [inference-control](inference-control): inference control
  experiments, replace depth by control functions.

- [iterative-chaining](iterative-chaining): save intermediary results
  while reasoning.

- [pln](pln): collection of PLN port attempts.

- [polyward-chaining](polyward-chaining): forward chaining experiments
  combined with backward chaining.

- [proof-tree](proof-tree): displaying proof tree, as well as
  generating fully annotated proof tree.

- [subtyping](subtyping): subtyping inference experiments.

- [sumo](sumo): attempt to reason over sumo.

- [synthesis](synthesis): program synthesis experiments, actually
  uncurried backward chaining experiment.
